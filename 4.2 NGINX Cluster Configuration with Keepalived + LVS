4.2.3 Procedure
Step 1 Install Keepalived and ipvsadm on LVS1 and LVS2 ECSs.
Run the following command:
yum install -y keepalived ipvsadm

Step 2 Modify the configuration file of LVS1.
Modify the Keepalived configuration file of LVS1 as follows:
! Configuration File for keepalived
global_defs {
 router_id Cluster1
}
vrrp_instance Nginx {
 state MASTER
 interface ens192
 mcast_src_ip 20.0.0.1
 virtual_router_id 51
 priority 255
 advert_int 1
 authentication {
 auth_type PASS
 auth_pass 1111
 }
 virtual_ipaddress {
 192.168.1.20/24
 }
}
virtual_server 192.168.1.20 80 {
 delay_loop 6
 lb_algo rr
 lb_kind DR
 persistence_timeout 50
 protocol TCP
 real_server 192.168.1.14 80 {
 weight 1
 TCP_CHECK {
 connect_timeout 3
 retry 3
 delay_before_retry 3
 }
 }
 real_server 192.168.1.15 80 {
 weight 2
 TCP_CHECK {
 connect_timeout 3
 retry 3
 delay_before_retry 3
 }
 }
}


Step 3 Modify the configuration file of LVS2.
Modify the Keepalived configuration file of LVS2 as follows:

! Configuration File for keepalived
global_defs {
 router_id Cluster2
}
vrrp_instance Nginx {
 state BACKUP
 interface ens192
 mcast_src_ip 20.0.0.2
 virtual_router_id 51
 priority 100
 advert_int 1
 authentication {
 auth_type PASS
 auth_pass 1111
 }
 virtual_ipaddress {
 192.168.1.20/24
 }
}
virtual_server 192.168.1.20 80 {
 delay_loop 6
 lb_algo rr
 lb_kind DR
 persistence_timeout 50
 protocol TCP
 real_server 192.168.1.14 80 {
 weight 1
 TCP_CHECK {
 connect_timeout 3
 retry 3
 delay_before_retry 3
 }
 }
 real_server 192.168.1.15 80 {
 weight 2
 TCP_CHECK {
 connect_timeout 3
 retry 3
 delay_before_retry 3
 }
 }
}

Step 4 Perform a test.
After the two LVS servers are configured, restart them and perform an access test on the
client. The result is as follows:
curl 192.168.1.20
curl 192.168.1.20
curl 192.168.1.20
curl 192.168.1.20



As shown in the preceding figure, LVS connections are configured as persistent
connections by default, and the timeout interval is set to 50. Therefore, each request is
forwarded to the server allocated for the first time. You can comment out related
configurations in the Keepalived configuration file to implement load balancing. See the
following figure.
